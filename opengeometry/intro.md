# OpenGeometry

OpenGeometry provides set of tools for creating and manipulating 2D and 3D geometries. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and highly extensible. 

The core OpenGeometry Kernel is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, allowing it to run efficiently in the browser. This makes it possible to create complex geometries and perform advanced calculations without sacrificing performance.

OpenGeometry can be used inside Three.js, Babylon.js, and other WebGL-based libraries.
Currently, the rendering is managed using Three.js and we are working on adding support for Babylon.js and other libraries in the future.

The library is open source and is available on GitHub, we are open for contributors and suggestions.
It is actively maintained.
<!-- We welcome any contributions, whether it's bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements. If you're interested in contributing, please check out our [contributing guidelines] -->

### Purpose
We feel the current tools lacks creative freedom, we want to shift the power into the user hands. We want to help Designer, Engineers and Architects create beautiful and elegant designs without worrying about the software limitations.
